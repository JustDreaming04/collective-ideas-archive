     • Dose: 1½ scoops (≈3 g citrulline) every 6 hours (4×/day)

     • Benefit: Locks in each NO surge for smooth, prolonged vessel opening

  6) EXERCISE & SAUNA (LIFESTYLE REMODELING)
     • Exercise (Shear Stress): 20 min brisk walking or cycling, 3–4×/week
       – Immediate ↑ NO; shear-stress–driven eNOS up-regulation
       – Elevated flow 2–4 hours post, cumulative capillary growth over weeks
     • Sauna (Heat Stress): 10 minutes at ≥80 °C, 1–2×/week
       – Doubles cardiac output and total blood flow within 10 minutes
       – Heat-shock proteins + shear stress → mitochondrial and vascular remodeling
       – Elevated eNOS expression & flow for 12–24 hours

  7) DAILY HABITS & SUPPORT
     • Calf Raises / Ankle Pumps: 1 minute every 30–60 min seated/standing → venous return
     • Leg Elevation: 2–5 min every 2–3 hours → resets hydrostatic pressure
     • Hydration: 0.5–1 oz water per pound bodyweight → maintains plasma volume
     • Electrolytes: pinch of sea salt or balanced drink → optimal blood fluidity

Citrulline → NO → cGMP

    You take citrulline, your body makes arginine, eNOS converts that into NO.

    NO diffuses into smooth-muscle cells and activates guanylate cyclase, which churns out cGMP.

    cGMP is the actual second messenger that tells your vessels to relax and dilate.


PDE-5’s job

    Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) is the enzyme that breaks down cGMP back into GMP—so once PDE-5 kicks in, your dilation signal fades.


Tadalafil’s role

    Tadalafil blocks PDE-5, so cGMP hangs around much longer (24–36 h with a single low dose).

    Even when your NO pulse from citrulline has dissipated, you still have high cGMP levels keeping those vessels open.

Why This Sequence Matters
Substrate First (Citrulline)
You need the raw material (arginine) before any enzyme can make NO.

Enzyme Coupling (Folate & Magnesium)
Keeps the NO-making machinery (eNOS) honest—making NO, not harmful radicals.

Antioxidant Shield (Garlic & Pine Bark)
Scavenges free radicals instantly, so your freshly made NO isn’t destroyed the moment it appears.
• Garlic turns on your body’s internal cleanup crew (SOD, glutathione)
• Pine bark both scavenges and cranks eNOS to higher output

Lock-In (Tadalafil)
Once NO makes cGMP, tadalafil prevents its breakdown—so dilation lasts 24–36 hours instead of seconds.

Remodeling (Exercise & Sauna)
Acute boosts are great, but shear stress (from exercise) and heat stress (from sauna) signal your blood vessels to grow and stay more compliant—making your new, high-flow state permanent.

Movement & Hydration
Keeps blood moving comfortably between doses and prevents dehydration-induced pooling.
